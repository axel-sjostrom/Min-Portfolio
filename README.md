# Min-Portfolio
Hello, my name is Axel Sjöström and I'm a high school student at the Stockholm Science and Innovation School, Sweden.
I started coding autumn 2017, and so far C# is the only programming language I've worked in. However, i have some experience with
web development - both front end with HTML, CSS and JavaScript, aswell as some back end with PHP and MySQL.
You can check out some of my work in my wikipage, which you can find in this depositry.
